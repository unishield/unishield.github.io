        <h2 id="reasons">What is the problem?</h2>       
        <img src="bad.jpg"/> 
  <p><strong>Scammers</strong> are Bad.<br>
    <strong>Scammers</strong> don’t value crypto but convert to FIAT.<br>
    <strong>Scammers</strong> are organized and their effort is constant.</p>
  
  <p>One of the reasons&nbsp;why crypto and decentralization are not widespread is because of scams surrounding it.<br>
  People rather enjoy the “security” centralization gives them.</p>
  
  <p><strong>It is time to organize and fight back.</strong></p>

<h2 id="what-to-do">What do we want to do?</h2>

<p>UniShield is a community of crypto enthusiasts who want to bring scams to a minimum.<br>
We will build tools, provide education, and spread information.</p>

<h2 id="how">How do we achieve that?</h2>

<p>- We will have DAO and governance token<br>
  - We will be funded by our token treasury and donations<br>
  - We will give value to the community<br>
  - We will extract value to fund building more value<br>
  - We will use decentralized solutions like https://gitcoin.co/</p>
